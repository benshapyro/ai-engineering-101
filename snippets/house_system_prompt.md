# House System Prompt

This is a reusable system prompt header that can be prepended to examples for consistent behavior across the curriculum.

## Standard Header

```
You are a helpful AI assistant focused on teaching prompt engineering concepts.

Core Principles:
- Provide clear, accurate explanations
- Use concrete examples to illustrate concepts
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- Encourage experimentation and learning

Response Guidelines:
- Be concise but thorough
- Use proper formatting (markdown, code blocks)
- Cite sources when making specific claims
- Adapt complexity to the user's level

Constraints:
- Don't make up statistics or research
- Don't claim capabilities you don't have
- Admit when you don't know something
- Suggest alternatives when you can't fulfill a request
```

## Usage in Python

```python
# Load and use the house system prompt
import os

def load_house_prompt(filename: str = "snippets/house_system_prompt.md") -> str:
    """Load the standard system prompt."""
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Extract the prompt from markdown code block
    if "```" in content:
        start = content.find("```") + 3
        end = content.find("```", start)
        return content[start:end].strip()

    return content

# Example usage
from llm.client import LLMClient

client = LLMClient()
house_prompt = load_house_prompt()

# Use as base system prompt
response = client.generate(
    input_text="Explain few-shot learning",
    instructions=house_prompt
)

# Or extend it for specific use cases
specialized_prompt = f"""{house_prompt}

Specialization:
You are specifically focused on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.
Provide implementation details using Python, LangChain, and ChromaDB.
"""

response = client.generate(
    input_text="How do I implement reranking?",
    instructions=specialized_prompt
)
```

- Include metrics and benchmarks when relevant
```

## Integration with Modules

### Module 01-03: Fundamentals

Use the standard header as-is. Focus on clear explanations and basic examples.

### Module 04-06: Intermediate Techniques

Extend with technique-specific guidance:

```python
house_prompt = load_house_prompt()
cot_prompt = f"""{house_prompt}

Chain-of-Thought Focus:
- Show explicit reasoning steps
- Break down complex problems
- Demonstrate step-by-step thinking
- Explain the rationale for each step
"""
```

### Module 07-11: Advanced Patterns

Add production considerations:

```python
house_prompt = load_house_prompt()
production_prompt = f"""{house_prompt}

Production Considerations:
- Discuss error handling and edge cases
- Consider scalability and performance
- Address cost optimization
- Include monitoring and observability
"""
```

### Module 12-14: Expert Topics

Focus on optimization and real-world deployment:

```python
house_prompt = load_house_prompt()
expert_prompt = f"""{house_prompt}

Expert-Level Focus:
- Assume advanced understanding
- Provide detailed technical analysis
- Compare multiple approaches
- Include performance benchmarks
- Address production deployment challenges
"""
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Version History

- **v1.0** (2025-10-02): Initial version with standard header
- Future: May add module-specific variants as curriculum evolves

### When to Update

Update this prompt when:
- Core teaching philosophy changes
- New constraints or guidelines are established
- Feedback indicates inconsistent behavior across examples
- Major curriculum restructuring occurs

### Testing Changes

When updating the house prompt, test across:
1. Representative examples from each module
2. Edge cases (errors, unclear requests, etc.)
3. Multi-turn conversations
4. Different model versions

```python
# Simple test harness
def test_house_prompt_stability():
    """Test that house prompt produces consistent results."""
    from shared.repro import DeterministicClient
    from llm.client import LLMClient

    client = LLMClient()
    det_client = DeterministicClient(client, temperature=0.0)

    house_prompt = load_house_prompt()

    test_queries = [
        "What is prompt engineering?",
        "Explain temperature parameter",
        "How do I handle API errors?"
    ]

    for query in test_queries:
        response = det_client.generate(
            query,
            instructions=house_prompt
        )

        # Verify response quality
        assert len(response) > 50, "Response too short"
        assert "I don't know" not in response.lower() or "?" in query

        print(f"âœ“ {query[:30]}... passed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_house_prompt_stability()
```
