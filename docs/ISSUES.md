# Known Issues - Prompt Engineering Curriculum

This document tracks known issues and areas for improvement in the curriculum.

## 🔴 Critical Issues
None currently.

## 🟡 Moderate Issues
None currently. All issues have been resolved! ✅

### ~~1. Missing Dependencies in requirements.txt~~ [RESOLVED]
- **Location**: `requirements.txt`
- **Issue**: Several dependencies were not listed
- **Resolution**: Added scikit-learn, aiofiles, sqlalchemy, PyJWT, PyYAML to requirements.txt
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### ~~2. Incorrect File Path Reference in Module 01 README~~ [RESOLVED]
- **Location**: `01-fundamentals/README.md` line 169
- **Issue**: README referenced wrong file path
- **Resolution**: Changed from `exercises/prompt_library_starter.py` to `project/prompt_library_starter.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### ~~1. Module 01 - Missing Example Files~~ [RESOLVED]
- **Location**: `01-fundamentals/examples/`
- **Issue**: Only contained 1 example file (`basic_prompting.py`)
- **Resolution**: Added `prompt_anatomy.py` and `temperature_effects.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### ~~2. Module 07 - Duplicate Directory~~ [RESOLVED]
- **Location**: Root directory
- **Issue**: Two Module 07 directories existed
- **Resolution**: Removed `07-context-window-management/` directory
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## 🟢 Minor Issues

### 1. Code Quality - No Syntax Errors Detected
- **Status**: All 86 Python files compile successfully with no syntax errors ✅

### 2. Naming Consistency
- **Issue**: Module 07 uses "context-management" while initially may have been planned as "context-window-management"
- **Impact**: Minimal - current naming is actually more concise
- **Status**: Can remain as-is

### 3. Import Consistency
- **Observation**: All files correctly import from `shared.utils` and use consistent path handling
- **Status**: Working as expected ✅

## ✅ Verified Complete

### All Modules (01-14)
- ✅ All have README.md files
- ✅ All have proper directory structure (examples/, exercises/, solutions/, project/)
- ✅ All have exercises.py files
- ✅ All have solutions.py files
- ✅ All have at least one project file

### Module File Counts
- **All Modules 01-14**: 3 examples each ✅
- **All modules**: Have complete exercises and solutions ✅
- **All modules**: Have project implementations ✅

### Special Files
- **Module 02**: Has `task_templates.json` in project (intentional) ✅
- **Module 03**: Has `example_library.json` in project (intentional) ✅
- **Shared utilities**: Complete with `utils.py` and `prompts.py` ✅

## 📊 Overall Assessment

**Completion Status**: 100% ✅

The curriculum is now fully complete! All 14 modules are production-ready with:
- Comprehensive examples (3 files each) ✅
- Complete exercises with solutions ✅
