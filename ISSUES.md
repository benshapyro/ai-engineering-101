This document tracks known issues and areas for improvement in the curriculum.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
None currently.

## ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Issues
None currently. All previously identified issues have been resolved! âœ…

### ~~1. Module 01 - Missing Example Files~~ [RESOLVED]
- **Location**: `01-fundamentals/examples/`
- **Issue**: Only contained 1 example file (`basic_prompting.py`)
- **Resolution**: Added `prompt_anatomy.py` and `temperature_effects.py`
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

### ~~2. Module 07 - Duplicate Directory~~ [RESOLVED]
- **Location**: Root directory
- **Issue**: Two Module 07 directories existed
- **Resolution**: Removed `07-context-window-management/` directory
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues

### 1. Naming Consistency
- **Issue**: Module 07 uses "context-management" while initially may have been planned as "context-window-management"
- **Impact**: Minimal - current naming is actually more concise
- **Status**: Can remain as-is

## âœ… Verified Complete

### All Modules (01-14)
- âœ… All have README.md files
- âœ… All have proper directory structure (examples/, exercises/, solutions/, project/)
- âœ… All have exercises.py files
- âœ… All have solutions.py files
- âœ… All have at least one project file

### Module File Counts
- **All Modules 01-14**: 3 examples each âœ…
- **All modules**: Have complete exercises and solutions âœ…
- **All modules**: Have project implementations âœ…

### Special Files
- **Module 02**: Has `task_templates.json` in project (intentional) âœ…
- **Module 03**: Has `example_library.json` in project (intentional) âœ…
- **Shared utilities**: Complete with `utils.py` and `prompts.py` âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Overall Assessment

**Completion Status**: 100% âœ…

The curriculum is now complete! All 14 modules are fully implemented with:
- Comprehensive examples (3 files each)
- Complete exercises with solutions
- Production-ready project implementations
- Detailed README documentation

All previously identified issues have been resolved.

## ðŸ”§ Recommended Actions

All critical and moderate issues have been addressed. Optional future enhancements:
1. Consider adding cross-references between related modules in READMEs
2. Add integration tests for example code
3. Create a master glossary of terms
